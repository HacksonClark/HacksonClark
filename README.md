I'm a second-year PhD student in the Siebel School of Computing and Data Science at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign
(UIUC). I am "watched" by my advisor <a href="https://tianyin.github.io/">Tianyin Xu</a>.
<br />
<br />
My research explores practical AI and agent techniques for
safety-critical computer systems and infrastructures. 
My current work is in the AIOps space, specifically in AI for Site Reliability Engineering (SRE).
Previously, I collaborated with Microsoft Research and IBM Research to build LLM benchmarks (AIOpsLab, ITBench) and agents (STRATUS) for SRE.

I'm currently building [SREGym](https://github.com/SREGym/SREGym) to unify my prior benchmarking work.

<br />
In the past, I worked at NASA in the Space Technology Mission Directorate, where
I helped develop space systems for the International Space Station. 
I'm also an instructor at the Discovery Partners Institute at the
University of Illinois, where I teach a professional development class on Data Science to CPS high school teachers.
